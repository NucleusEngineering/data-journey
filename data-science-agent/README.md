# Data Science with Multiple Agents

## Overview

This part of the repository focuses on a multi-agent system specifically designed for in-depth gaming churn analysis. It combines several specialized agents to handle various stages, from retrieving player and game interaction data via BigQuery to executing complex data manipulations. The system leverages BigQuery ML (BQML) for predictive churn modeling and generates insightful text responses and data visualizations (plots, graphs) to explore churn drivers and patterns.

*   **Database Interaction (NL2SQL):** Employs a Database Agent to interact with BigQuery using natural language queries, translating them into SQL.
*   **Data Science Analysis (NL2Py):** Includes a Data Science Agent that performs data analysis and visualization using Python, based on natural language instructions.
*   **Machine Learning (BQML):** Features a BQML Agent that leverages BigQuery ML for training and evaluating machine learning models.
*   **Code Interpreter Integration:** Supports the use of a Code Interpreter extension in Vertex AI for executing Python code, enabling complex data analysis and manipulation.
*   **ADK Web GUI:** Offers a user-friendly GUI interface for interacting with the agents.
*   **Testability:** Includes a comprehensive test suite for ensuring the reliability of the agents.


## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   **Google Cloud Account:** You need a Google Cloud account with BigQuery enabled.
*   **Python 3.12+:** Ensure you have Python 3.12 or a later version installed.
*   **Poetry:** Install Poetry by following the instructions below.


### Project Setup:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NucleusEngineering/data-journey.git
    cd data-journey/data-science-agent
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies with Poetry:**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file and installs all the necessary dependencies into a virtual environment managed by Poetry.

3.  **Activate the Poetry Shell:**

    ```bash
    poetry env activate
    ```

    This activates the virtual environment, allowing you to run commands within the project's environment. To make sure the environment is active, use for example:
    
    ```bash
    poetry env list
    ```
    
    This is the output you should get:  data-science-FAlhSuLn-py3.13 (Activated).

    If the above command did not activate the environment for you, you can also activate it through:

     ```bash
    source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
    ```

5.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Rename the file ".env-example" to ".env" and fill the below values:

    ```bash
    #  Vertex backend config
    
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION='YOUR_VALUE_HERE'
    ```

6.  **BigQuery Setup:**
 
    *   First, set the BigQuery project ID (same as your project id)  and `BQ_DATASET_ID` in the `.env` file. 
    *   You will find the datasets inside 'data-science-agent/utils/data/'.
        Make sure you are still in the working directory (`data-journey/data-science-agent`). To load the test and train tables into BigQuery, run the following commands:
        ```bash
        python3 data_science/utils/create_bq_table.py
        ```


7.  **BQML Setup:**
    The BQML Agent uses the Vertex AI RAG Engine to query the full BigQuery ML Reference Guide.

    Before running the setup, ensure your project ID is added in .env file: `"GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"`.
    Leave the corpus name empty in the .env file: `BQML_RAG_CORPUS_NAME = ''`. The corpus name will be added automatically once it's created.

    To set up the RAG Corpus for your project, run the methods `create_RAG_corpus()` and `ingest_files()` in
    `data-science/data_science/utils/reference_guide_RAG.py` by running the below command from the working directory:

    ```bash
    python3 data_science/utils/reference_guide_RAG.py
    ```


8.  **(optional step) Other Environment Variables:**

    *   `NL2SQL_METHOD`: (Optional) Either `BASELINE` or `CHASE`. Sets the method for SQL Generation. Baseline uses Gemini off-the-shelf, whereas CHASE uses [CHASE-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01943)
    *   `CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME`: (Optional) The full resource name of
        a pre-existing Code Interpreter extension in Vertex AI. If not provided,
        a new extension will be created. (e.g.,
        `projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/locations/<YOUR_LOCATION>/extensions/<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>`).
        Check the logs/terminal for the ID of the newly created Code Interpreter
        Extension and provide the value in your environment variables to avoid
        creating multiple extensions.

    From the terminal:

    ```bash
    export CODE_INTERPRETER_EXTENSION_NAME='projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/locations/us-central1/extensions/<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>'
    ```

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent using the ADK command in your terminal.
from the working directory:

1.  Run agent in CLI:

    ```bash
    poetry run adk run data_science
    ```

2.  Run agent with ADK Web UI:
    ```bash
    poetry run adk web
    ```
    Select the data_science from the dropdown


### Example Agent Interaction

Here's a quick example of how a user might interact with the Data Science Multi-Agent System:

> Â´**User:** Hi, What data do you have access to?

> **Agent:**  I have access to two tables: `train` and `test`. These tables contain user engagement data, including country, operating system, language, and various engagement metrics, as well as a churned label.

> **User:** Please generate a plot of user distribution per country.

> **Agent:**  Result: The bar plot displays the user distribution per country, with the United States having the highest number of users.

> Explanation:
  I queried the database to retrieve the number of users per country from the train table.  
  I used the data science agent to generate a bar plot visualizing this distribution.
  The x-axis of the plot represents the countries, and the y-axis represents the number of users.
  The plot clearly shows that the United States has a significantly higher number of users compared to other countries.

> **User:** What kinds of forecasting models can I train in BQML?

> **Agent:** You can train several types of forecasting models in BQML, including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) models. Would you like to proceed with training a forecasting model?

> **User:** Yes

> **Agent:** Okay, before proceeding, let's confirm the project and dataset ID for BQML. We'll be using the `PROJECT_ID` project and the `BQ_DATASET_ID` dataset. Does that sound right?

> **User:** Yes

> **Agent:** The BQML supports `ARIMA_PLUS`, `ARIMA_PLUS_XREG`.

>To proceed, I need to know which model you'd like to use. I also need to know the following:

>*   The name of the column that provides the time points (e.g., 'date').
>*   The name of the column that contains the data to forecast (e.g., 'num_sold').
>*   Do you want to fit and forecast multiple time series using a single query? If so, what are the ID columns?


## Running Evaluations


Evaluation tests assess the overall performance and capabilities of the agent in a holistic manner.

**Run Evaluation Tests:**

```bash
poetry run pytest eval
```

- This command executes all test files within the `eval/` directory.
- `poetry run` ensures that pytest runs within the project's virtual environment.


## Running Tests

Tests assess the overall executability of the agents.

**Test Categories:**

*   **Integration Tests:** These tests verify that the agents can interact correctly with each other and with external services like BigQuery. They ensure that the root agent can delegate tasks to the appropriate sub-agents and that the sub-agents can perform their intended tasks.
*   **Sub-Agent Functionality Tests:** These tests focus on the specific capabilities of each sub-agent (e.g., Database Agent, BQML Agent). They ensure that each sub-agent can perform its intended tasks, such as executing SQL queries or training BQML models.
*   **Environment Query Tests:** These tests verify that the agent can handle queries that are based on the environment.

**Run Tests:**

```bash 
poetry run pytest tests
```

- This command executes all test files within the `tests/` directory.
- `poetry run` ensures that pytest runs within the project's virtual environment.



## Deployment on Vertex AI Agent Engine

To deploy the agent to Google Agent Engine, first follow
[these steps](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/set-up)
to set up your Google Cloud project for Agent Engine.

You also need to give BigQuery User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Vertex AI User
permissions to the Reasoning Engine Service Agent. Run the following commands to
grant the required permissions:

```bash
export RE_SA="service-${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/bigquery.user"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT} \
    --member="serviceAccount:${RE_SA}" \
    --condition=None \
    --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
```

Next, you need to create a `.whl` file for your agent. From the `data-science`
directory, run this command:

```bash
poetry build --format=wheel --output=deployment
```

This will create a file named `data_science-0.1-py3-none-any.whl` in the
`deployment` directory.

Then run the below command. This will create a staging bucket in your GCP project and deploy the agent to Vertex AI Agent Engine:

```bash
cd deployment/
python3 deploy.py --create
```

When this command returns, if it succeeds it will print an AgentEngine resource
name that looks something like this:
```
projects/************/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/7737333693403889664
```
The last sequence of digits is the AgentEngine resource ID.

Once you have successfully deployed your agent, you can interact with it
using the `test_deployment.py` script in the `deployment` directory. Store the
agent's resource ID in an environment variable and run the following command:

```bash
export RESOURCE_ID=...
export USER_ID=<any string>
python test_deployment.py --resource_id=$RESOURCE_ID --user_id=$USER_ID
```

The session will look something like this:
```
Found agent with resource ID: ...
Created session for user ID: ...
Type 'quit' to exit.
Input: Hello. What data do you have?
Response: I have access to the train and test tables inside the forecasting_sticker_sales dataset.
...
```

Note that this is *not* a full-featured, production-ready CLI; it is just intended to
show how to use the Agent Engine API to interact with a deployed agent.

The main part of the `test_deployment.py` script is approximately this code:

```python
from vertexai import agent_engines
remote_agent = vertexai.agent_engines.get(RESOURCE_ID)
session = remote_agent.create_session(user_id=USER_ID)
while True:
    user_input = input("Input: ")
    if user_input == "quit":
      break

    for event in remote_agent.stream_query(
        user_id=USER_ID,
        session_id=session["id"],
        message=user_input,
    ):
        parts = event["content"]["parts"]
        for part in parts:
            if "text" in part:
                text_part = part["text"]
                print(f"Response: {text_part}")
```

To delete the agent, run the following command (using the resource ID returned previously):
```bash
python3 deployment/deploy.py --delete --resource_id=RESOURCE_ID
```



## Optimizing and Adjustment Tips

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompts for `root_agent`, `bqml_agent`, `db_agent`
    and `ds_agent` to improve accuracy and guide the agents more effectively.
    Experiment with different phrasing and levels of detail.
*   **Extension:** Extend the multi-agent system with your own AgentTools or sub_agents.
    You can do so by adding additional tools and sub_agents to the root agent inside
    `agents/data-science/data_science/agent.py`.
*   **Partial imports:** If you only need certain capabilities inside the multi-agent system,
    e.g. just the data agent, you can import the data_agent as an AgentTool into your own root agent.
*   **Model Selection:** Try different language models for both the top-level
    agent and the sub-agents to find the best performance for your data and
    queries.


## Troubleshooting

*   If you face `500 Internal Server Errors` when running the agent, simply re-run your last command.
    That should fix the issue.
*   If you encounter issues with the code interpreter, review the logs to
    understand the errors. Make sure you're using base-64 encoding for
    files/images if interacting directly with a code interpreter extension
    instead of through the agent's helper functions.
*   If you see errors in the SQL generated, try the following:
    - including clear descriptions in your tables and columns help boost performance
    - if your database is large, try setting up a RAG pipeline for schema linking by storing your table schema details in a vector store
